# OBJ file for a simple Octahedron
# Vertices: 6
# Faces: 8 (all triangles)

# Vertices (v)
# Apexes along Y-axis
v 0.0 1.0 0.0      # 1: Top Apex (North Pole)
v 0.0 -1.0 0.0     # 2: Bottom Apex (South Pole)

# Vertices on the XZ-plane (equator)
v 1.0 0.0 0.0      # 3: East
v 0.0 0.0 1.0      # 4: North
v -1.0 0.0 0.0     # 5: West
v 0.0 0.0 -1.0     # 6: South

# Faces (f)
# Each face is a triangle defined by 3 vertex indices.
# Top Pyramid Faces (connected to Vertex 1)
f 1 3 4            # Top-East-North
f 1 4 5            # Top-North-West
f 1 5 6            # Top-West-South
f 1 6 3            # Top-South-East (closes the loop)

# Bottom Pyramid Faces (connected to Vertex 2)
# Vertices are typically ordered counter-clockwise when viewed from outside the object.
# For bottom faces, this usually means reversing the order of the equatorial vertices relative to the top faces.
